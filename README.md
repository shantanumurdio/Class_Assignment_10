This is a simple web page that allows you to interactively change the color and shape of a central element by clicking on buttons.

## Features

- Predefined colors are cycled through when changing the background color.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You will see a central circle element with an inner shape (initially a square).
3. Click the "Change Color" button to cycle through different background colors for the circle.
4. Click the "Change Shape" button to toggle between a square and a triangle as the inner shape of the circle.

## Files
